Hello there, traveller. Haven’t seen the likes of you before.
We don’t get too many visitors, since most races are unable to visit.
There was a ban after someone from the fire planet burned a whole town to the ground.
The ash from the fire did cause a great harvest though. It doubled the population!
If only we had something like that to help us now...
